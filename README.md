Thomas Bot is the friendly Discord bot! It hangs around in the official IT Factory Discord server.
It helps teachers doing their job and students also... sometimes... 

## Running locally

### Build manually
0. Make sure the [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install) is installed and working.
1. Make sure the required dependencies are installed:
    - On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros, install the following packages: 
        - [libsox-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libsox-dev) 
        - [libsdl2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libsdl2-dev) 
        - [portaudio19-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/portaudio19-dev)
        - [libopusfile-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libopusfile-dev) 
        - [libopus-dev](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libopus-dev)
        - [curl](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/curl)
    - On Arch-based distros, install the following packages: 
        - [libsoxr](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libsoxr/)
        - [sdl<sup>aur</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sdl)
        - [portaudio](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/portaudio/)
        - [opusfile](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/opusfile/)
    - On Windows, you're on your own for now :)
2. Compile and run the project:
    - On Unix-like systems, run `THOMASBOT_TOKEN={TOKEN} go run ./`, where `{TOKEN}` is your Discord bot's token.
    - On Windows, set the `THOMASBOT_TOKEN` environment variable through your [system properties](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/r-enterprise/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html). Then, run the bot using `go run ./`

### Docker
0. Make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and working.
1. Build the container using `docker build -t thomas-bot .`.
2. Run the image you've built using `docker run -it -e "THOMASBOT_TOKEN={TOKEN}" thomas-bot` where `{TOKEN}` is your Discord bot's token.
    - You can change the prefix by setting the `THOMASBOT_PREFIX` environment variable.

## Configuration
You can configure some aspects of the bot through configuration files. For instance, by setting the `THOMASBOT_PREFIX` you can change the prefix that is used to trigger the bot. See `main.go` for more options.
